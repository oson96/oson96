### Hello friend! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working as a structural engineer trying to get more familiar with the world of coding. My goal is to improve my coding skills so i can help developing new, faster and better workflows for structural engineers ðŸŒ±

Let me know if you want to learn together or if you have any tips and tricks that could be useful for me! :raised_hands:
